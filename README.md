## A full hardware replacement for a small battery powered nightlight, which includes a bottom case, PCB + Zigbee microcontroller
Inspired by Blinkekatze

## Why?
It sounded like a fun challenge!

# More to come as the project progresses 
I've got boards but am waiting on some replacement components because I fried a couple MCUs while soldering :)
